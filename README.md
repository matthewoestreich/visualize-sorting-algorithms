# Visualize Sorting Algorithms in JavaScript!

Check out a [live demo here](https://oze4.github.io/visualize-sorting-algorithms/)!

### About

We use generator functions to update the DOM while sorting.

### Colors

We [mostly] follow this color convention:

- Default colored `black`.
- Comparing colored `yellow`.
- Correct position colored `green`.
- Incorrect position colored `red`.
- Completed colored `blue`.
- Algorithm specific items (for example, the pivot in quick sort) are colored `cyan`.
